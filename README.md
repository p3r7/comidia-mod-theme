# Modified Comidia Theme 
An deftheme port of the popular emacs theme, comidia, with some additionnal tweeks to suit my taste.

## Tweaks
 - made compatible with emacs run inside a terminal
 - menubar style inspired by [cyberpunk-theme.el](https://github.com/n3mo/cyberpunk-theme.el)
 - better looking hl-line
